# Fix for "Version Unknown" and Missing License in PyInstaller Build

## Problem

When building the ZeroLog Viewer with PyInstaller, the application showed:
- "Version Unknown" in the window title and About dialog
- No license information displayed (empty or fallback message)

This was because PyInstaller creates a standalone executable that runs from a temporary directory, and the `VERSION` and `LICENSE` files were not being bundled with the executable.

## Root Cause

1. The original code used `Path(__file__).parent / 'VERSION'` to read version info
2. In PyInstaller executables, `__file__` points to a temporary extraction directory
3. The `VERSION` and `LICENSE` files were not included in the PyInstaller bundle
4. The build command (`pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ...`) didn't specify data files to include

## Solution

### 1. Created PyInstaller Spec File (`zerolog_viewer.spec`)

The spec file explicitly bundles resource files:

```python
datas = [
    (os.path.join(script_dir, 'VERSION'), '.'),
    (os.path.join(script_dir, 'LICENSE'), '.'),
]
```

### 2. Updated Resource Path Resolution

Added `get_resource_path()` function that works in both environments:

```python
def get_resource_path(relative_path: str) -> Path:
    try:
        # PyInstaller: use temporary extraction directory
        base_path = Path(sys._MEIPASS)
    except AttributeError:
        # Development: use source directory
        base_path = Path(__file__).parent
    return base_path / relative_path
```

### 3. Updated Version Info Function

Modified `get_version_info()` to:
- Use `get_resource_path()` to find the VERSION file
- Skip git version lookup in PyInstaller (not available in bundle)
- Provide better error messages

### 4. Added License Reading Function

Created `get_license_text()` to:
- Read license from bundled resource
- Provide fallback message if missing

### 5. Enhanced About Dialog

Updated `show_about()` to:
- Display actual version from VERSION file
- Add "View License" button
- Created `show_license()` dialog with full license text

### 6. Updated NSIS Installer

Modified `installer.nsi` to:
- Include VERSION and LICENSE files in installation directory (optional, for reference)
- Clean up these files during uninstall

### 7. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

Changed all build jobs to use the spec file:
```yaml
- name: Build executable with PyInstaller
  run: |
    pyinstaller zerolog_viewer.spec
```

### 8. Updated .gitignore

Modified to allow `zerolog_viewer.spec` while still ignoring auto-generated spec files.

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `test_version_and_license.py`:
- Verifies version info is read correctly
- Ensures version is not "Unknown"
- Validates license text content
- All 30 tests pass

## Benefits

1. **Correct Version Display**: Users see the actual version (e.g., "Version 0.3.0")
2. **License Visibility**: Full BSD 3-Clause license is accessible via About dialog
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Maintainable**: Single spec file manages all resource bundling
5. **Testable**: Automated tests verify functionality

## Files Changed

- `zerolog_viewer.py`: Added resource path handling and license display
- `zerolog_viewer.spec`: New file for PyInstaller configuration
- `installer.nsi`: Include VERSION and LICENSE in Windows installer
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Use spec file for all builds
- `.gitignore`: Allow spec file
- `test_version_and_license.py`: New tests for version/license reading
- `PYINSTALLER.md`: Documentation for PyInstaller configuration

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Build the executable: `pyinstaller zerolog_viewer.spec`
2. Run the executable: `./dist/zerolog_viewer`
3. Check window title shows version (e.g., "ZeroLog Viewer v0.3.0")
4. Open Help â†’ About and verify version is displayed
5. Click "View License" button and verify full license text is shown

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding an icon file to the bundle
- Could bundle README or other documentation
- Version info could be auto-generated from git tags during CI/CD
