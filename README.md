- üñ±Ô∏è **Drag & Drop**: Drag and drop files directly into the application
- üìä **Automatic column sizing**: Columns automatically adjust to content
- üïê **Time-based indexing**: Logs are automatically sorted by timestamp
- üîÑ **Sortable columns**: Click any column header to sort
- üîç **Debounced search**: Real-time search with 300ms debounce for smooth performance
- üìÖ **Date range filtering**: Filter logs by date range (optional)

## Building from Source

To create your own executable:

```bash
# Install dependencies including build tools
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name zerolog_viewer zerolog_viewer.py

# The executable will be in the dist/ folder
```

## Development

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- tkinterdnd2 (for drag and drop support)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test with the included sample files
python zerolog_viewer.py
# Then open sample_logs.jsonl or large_sample_logs.jsonl

# Run unit tests
python test_zerolog_viewer.py

# Run CLI tests
python test_cli.py
```

## Creating a Release

To create a new release with automated builds:

1. Update version in code if needed
2. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.1.0
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build executables for all platforms
4. Executables will be attached to the release

Alternatively, trigger a manual build via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch.
