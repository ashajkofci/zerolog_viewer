## Creating a Release

There are two ways to create a new release:

### Method 1: Manual Workflow Dispatch (Recommended)

1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Build and Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose version bump type:
   - **patch**: Bug fixes (0.2.0 ‚Üí 0.2.1)
   - **minor**: New features (0.2.0 ‚Üí 0.3.0)
   - **major**: Breaking changes (0.2.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0)
5. The workflow will:
   - Run all tests
   - Bump the version in the VERSION file
   - Create a git tag
   - Build packages for all platforms:
     - **Linux**: DEB package
     - **macOS**: DMG installer
     - **Windows**: Installer (with Start Menu shortcuts) and standalone executable
   - Create a GitHub release with all artifacts

### Method 2: Git Tag Push

1. Update the VERSION file manually
2. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.1.0
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build packages for all platforms
