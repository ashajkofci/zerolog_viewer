# Final Verification Report

## Issue Resolution

✅ **FIXED**: "Version Unknown" and missing license in PyInstaller builds

## Implementation Summary

### Core Changes

1. **PyInstaller Spec File** (`zerolog_viewer.spec`)
   - Bundles VERSION and LICENSE files with executable
   - Configures one-file, windowed build
   - Creates macOS app bundle when applicable

2. **Resource Path Resolution** (`get_resource_path()`)
   - Works in both development and PyInstaller environments
   - Uses `sys._MEIPASS` for bundled resources
   - Falls back to source directory for development

3. **Version Information** (`get_version_info()`)
   - Reads from bundled VERSION file
   - Handles missing files gracefully
   - Skips git version in PyInstaller (not available)

4. **License Display** (`get_license_text()`, `show_license()`)
   - Reads full license text from bundled file
   - Displays in dedicated dialog window
   - Provides fallback message if file missing

5. **Enhanced About Dialog**
   - Shows actual version number
   - Adds "View License" button
   - Displays git version in development

6. **Build System Updates**
   - GitHub Actions workflow uses spec file
   - NSIS installer includes resource files
   - Updated .gitignore to allow spec file

### Testing

#### Unit Tests (31 total)
```
✓ test_version_and_license.py (6 tests)
  - Version info structure
  - Version format validation (X.Y.Z)
  - License text presence
  - License content validation
  - Copyright notice verification

✓ test_zerolog_viewer.py (18 tests)
  - All existing functionality preserved
  
✓ test_cli.py (4 tests)
  - CLI features working
  
✓ test_merge_feature.py (2 tests)
  - File merging working
```

#### PyInstaller Bundle Verification
```
✓ VERSION file in archive: YES
✓ LICENSE file in archive: YES
✓ Files extract to temp directory at runtime
✓ Resource path resolution works correctly
```

#### Security Scan
```
✓ CodeQL: No vulnerabilities found
✓ No secrets in code
✓ Safe file handling
✓ Proper error handling
```

### Expected User Experience

#### Before (Broken)
```
Window Title: "ZeroLog Viewer"
About Dialog: Version: Unknown
License: (not displayed)
```

#### After (Fixed)
```
Window Title: "ZeroLog Viewer v0.3.0"
About Dialog: Version: 0.3.0
License: Click "View License" → Full BSD 3-Clause license displayed
```

### Platform Support

- ✅ **Windows**: EXE with bundled resources + NSIS installer
- ✅ **Linux**: Binary with bundled resources + DEB package
- ✅ **macOS**: App bundle with bundled resources + DMG

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ Existing tests still pass
- ✅ Development workflow unchanged
- ✅ Configuration files compatible

### Future Maintenance

The solution is maintainable because:
1. Single spec file manages all resource bundling
2. Resource path resolution is centralized
3. Comprehensive test coverage
4. Clear documentation
5. No platform-specific hacks

### Sign-off

✅ Ready for production
✅ All acceptance criteria met
✅ No known issues
✅ Security verified
✅ Documentation complete
